# Learn Concepts In Java
An on-going library where concepts are implemented in Java
- Only for learning purposes! Do not use in production!
  - Topics range from data structures, mazes, nlp, etc. Just stuff I've been interested in a bit but feel free to let me know if there is a topic I should cover!
- I may also store notes from time to time.
