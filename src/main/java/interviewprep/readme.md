# Interview Preparation
This package is entirely dedicated to preparing for coding interviews.

## Todo still a work in progress
- Will continue to add more as I continue learning more about companies ask, what not to do (since I don't really prepare for interviews), and more.

## Sections
- Common techniques
- Algorithms to know
- Data Structures and when might be helpful
- Coding problems


## General Notes
- Approaching Coding Interviews
  - Steps
    - Always ask clarification questions first
      - **Size of data code needs to handle**
      - Limits on input, what's valid and what's not, and etc.
    - Go over simple examples to understand requirements
    - Discuss approaches and get approval from interviewer to start coding implementation
    - While coding explain line by line what you are doing and maybe explain why
    - Run a few test runs to see if code works
  - Things to consider
    - Treat interviewers like colleagues on a team
    - **Any solution is better than no solution**
    - Remember to code like you would in production
    - Interviews may give hints (maybe helpful) or not
      - **Always think about potential state of your code, the code you wrote, and etc**
        - Ex: If designing a data structure, make sure you clear memory
        - Ex:
