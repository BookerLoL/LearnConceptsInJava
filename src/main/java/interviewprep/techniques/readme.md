# Common Techniques 
These techniques are commonly used in many problems that you should consider when trying to come up with a solution 

## Dynamic Programming
- Solve smaller sub-problems optimally and using those results to solve the bigger and harder problem
- Brute force recursion -> Memoization -> Dynamic Programming


## Greedy Approach
-
