/**
 * This class is designed to show you an example of how to optimize code in
 * general by using primivites over the wrapper classes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Wrapper classes uses boxing mechanics, so primitive is much better to reduce
 * memory and improve speed.
 * 
 * Avoid using BitInteger and BitDecimal unless you have to use them due to
 * range of values. They require a lot more time to perform calculations and
 * require more memory.
